I have watched countless software engineers struggle to communicate with the business team and fail to voice their ideas. So, I didn’t rush to jump into a career in dev right after graduating college with a CS degree.

## Career
My journey in tech began in the February of 2018 with [JoomShaper](https://www.joomshaper.com/){:target="_blank"} (one of the pioneering companies in Joomla technology) as a Technical Writer. I still remember the warm welcome I received the very first day.

*Look at me enjoying my first day at work.*

I spent the most productive 2 years of my life at JoomShaper where I got to learn a lot from the team. The workplace turned into a home, the team became a family, and everyone developed a lifelong bond.

Like every good tales, my story at JoomShape came to an end in Feb 2020, as I've taken a bigger role at [Axilweb](https://www.axilweb.com/){:target="_blank"}. Even though I'm smiling on the video, I cannot put into words how devasted I felt leaving my beloved family behind.

## My Standards 

**No Work Is Better Than Shitty Work**

There. I said it. And will always stand by it. To me quality tops everything.

Let’s say you have this superpower using which you can either date as many partners as you like or find your soulmate. What would you choose? I’d pick the latter one. Because quality ensures fulfillment. Producing work that I like makes me content. I want to be remembered through my works. 

I believe it’s not the quantity of our work that lives on but the quality of it. 

**Research, Research & Research Some More** 

The product is the star of my writing. It’s the protagonist around which my story evolves. 

The more we know about something, the better we can explain it to others. It’s true for anybody. When you research enough, you know almost everything there is to know. This is how we can make sure to tell the target audience what they need to know. 

The key to writing effective copy is to know every little detail about the product. 

**Keep It Simple, Stupid**

Everyone is busy. Nobody has the time to figure out any complex prose. 

If consumers don’t understand what you mean within seconds — they’ll simply move on. The average human attention span is 8 seconds. Currently, the lowest in the history of mankind. If we cannot communicate within the first few seconds, there’s no point in trying at all. 

*Fun fact: 5 buck says you won’t find any complex jargon on my website.*
